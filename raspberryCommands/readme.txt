Here are the commands used to config raspberry pi from the ground up.

First I installed a fresh raspbian stretch lite from official site.

Here's the link.

Current version is 4.14.and document every command used for configuring and testing the raspberry pi.

Command are divided in two categories.
1st those that used to configure the raspbian or installing needed packages.
2nd those that used to test the configurations or installed packages.
